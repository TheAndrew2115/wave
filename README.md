This is a simple game using the JFrame library, and is heavily
based off the popular game Geometry Wars on Xbox, minus the ability
to shoot enemies.

The purpose of the player is to avoid getting hit by the enemies that
spawn in and move around. There are several different types of enemies,
from dumb, mindless-moving shapes to smarter enemies that predict where the
player is going.

All you have to do to try this game yourself is to download and build the project
in an editor of your choice.

There are many more things that can be added to the game:
- High score feature
- Multiplayer mode
- Shooting Mechanic (This one is hard since JFrame is very blocky)
- Anything you want
